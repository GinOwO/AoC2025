# AoC2025

Me trying to speedsolve AoC (if I wake up in time)

Times:

D1: Forgot to wake up

D2: 00:01:30 / 00:02:15

D3: Forgot to wake up

D4: 00:00:50 / 00:01:40

D5: 00:04:37 / 00:13:50 (Got stuck in part 2 because of a typo I made during list merge)

D6: 00:03:20 / 00:10:33 (I hate having to include whitespaces in the table itself :skull:, then remembered zip_longest existed)

D7: TBD
