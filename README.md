# AoC2025

Me trying to speedsolve AoC (if I wake up in time)

Times:

D1: Forgot to wake up

D2: 00:01:30 / 00:02:15

D3: Forgot to wake up

D4: 00:00:50 / 00:01:40

D5: 00:04:37 / 00:13:50 (Got stuck in part 2 because of a typo I made during list merge)

D6: 00:03:20 / 00:10:33 (I hate having to include whitespaces in the table itself :skull:, then remembered zip_longest existed)

D7: 00:13:20 / 00:22:00

D8: Forgot to wake up

D9: 00:01:45 / 00:46:37 (I hate geometry with a passion)

D10: 00:10:11 / 00:59:37 (Tried bruting with bfs and A*, gave up and tried manually making a linalg solver, gave up and tried using numpy alone, wrong output and finally used scipy)

D11: 00:02:21 / 00:10:39 (Relatively easy icl)

D12: NO / NO + 00:00:01 (Tried with brutus, took like an hour and didnt finish. Then I open the subreddit and see you just need to check the areas needed omfg gg, im going back to dumb assembly shit now bye)
